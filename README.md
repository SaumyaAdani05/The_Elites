### Coastal Threat Alert System ðŸŒŠ

A comprehensive early warning and alerting platform using AI/ML to predict and mitigate coastal threats, protecting blue carbon habitats and coastal communities.

### About The Project

Coastal areas are critical for biodiversity and blue carbon storage but are increasingly vulnerable to threats like storm surges, erosion, pollution, and cyclonic activity. This project is a comprehensive **Coastal Threat Alert System** designed to provide early warnings and actionable alerts to safeguard lives, economies, and vital marine ecosystems.

The platform ingests real-time data from various sources, including physical sensors (tide gauges, weather stations) and satellite feeds. Using **AI and Machine Learning models**, it analyzes this data to detect anomalies and predict looming threats such as rising sea levels, harmful algal blooms, or extreme weather events.

Alerts are disseminated through an interactive web dashboard, enabling timely interventions by disaster management authorities, coastal city governments, and local communities.

### âœ¨ Features

  * **Real-time Monitoring Dashboard**: An interactive web interface displaying live data on sea level, wave height, water quality, and overall threat level.
  * **AI-Powered Threat Prediction**: Utilizes a TensorFlow.js model to analyze data and predict threat levels (Low, Medium, High) with a confidence score.
  * **Data Visualization**: Includes dynamic charts for trend analysis, environmental factor comparison, and anomaly detection.
  * **Actionable Recommendations**: An AI engine provides clear, actionable recommendations based on the current threat assessment.
  * **User Authentication & Data Export**: Secure login for authorized users and functionality to export historical data as a CSV file.

-----

### ðŸ’» Tech Stack

  * **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
  * **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow.js (Client-side)
  * **Data Visualization**: Chart.js
  * **Future Backend Integration**: Python (TensorFlow, PyTorch), Data Ingestion Pipelines
  * **Future Alerting System**: SMS/Push Notification APIs
